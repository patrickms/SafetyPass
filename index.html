<h1>SafetyPass</h1>
SafetyPass is a simple password system that generates computer generated passwords for each site. You launch a bookmarklet,
which launches a separate iframe (not accesible to the parent site). The iframe launches a password generator which
takes a password and a domain and generates a site specific password. The passwords are never stored anywhere and
our never communicated with our server. To get started, drag the link below onto your bookmarks bar, and click it whenever
you need a site specifc password.
